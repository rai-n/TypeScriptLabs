# Notes

## What is TypeScript 
TypeScript adds new features on top of JavaScript but browsers cannot execute it. TypeScript is a powerful tool, a compiler to compile TypeScript code to JavaScript. 

## TypeScript adds types 
Allows you to find errors before scripts run during development. 

## Code example
JavaScript would concatenate below instead of adding. 
```
const add = (a, b) => a + b; 
console.log(add('2','3')); 

```

## Types
1. number - 1, 1.2, -2
2. string - 'hi', "hi", ``hi``
3. boolean - true, false
